# Mini-Airbnb: Full Stack Project

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This is my first full-stack project, a **Mini version of Airbnb**, an online hotel and stay booking platform. The project allows users to browse and book stays, with different routes and functionalities tailored for different users.

I built this project using the **MVC architecture** and implemented features such as **authentication, session handling, error handling, and validations**. As I continue my learning journey, I plan to improve and expand the project over time.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport.js
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS
- **Other Features:** Validations, Session options, Error handling, Environment variables, Routes (RESTful)

## ðŸŽ‰ My Experience as the Creator
This project has been an incredible learning experience for me! Developing both the frontend and backend gave me a deeper understanding of full-stack development. I really enjoyed building features, debugging issues, and deploying the application.

This marks the beginning of my journey into the **MERN stack**, and I am excited to explore more advanced concepts and enhance this project as I learn new technologies!
